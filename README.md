# Activity-Recognition-from-Chest-Mounted-Accelerometer

Source:

Uncalibrated Accelerometer Data are collected from 15 participantes performing 7 activities. The dataset provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.


Data Set Information:

--- The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest 
--- Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz 
--- Accelerometer Data are Uncalibrated 
--- Number of Participants: 15 
--- Number of Activities: 7 
--- Data Format: CSV


Attribute Information:

--- Data are separated by participant 
--- Each file contains the following information 
---- sequential number, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, label 
--- Labels are codified by numbers 
--- 1: Working at Computer 
--- 2: Standing Up, Walking and Going updown stairs 
--- 3: Standing 
--- 4: Walking 
--- 5: Going UpDown Stairs 
--- 6: Walking and Talking with Someone 
--- 7: Talking while Standing
